# Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance

## Overview

Welcome to the Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance project! This repository contains code and documentation for an autonomous system designed to navigate and avoid obstacles. The project aims to leverage various sensors and algorithms to achieve real-time obstacle detection and avoidance in robotic systems.

## Features

- Real-time obstacle detection using LDR sensor.
- Advanced path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Programming Language, e.g., Python 3.x]
- [Required Libraries/Frameworks, e.g., NumPy, OpenCV]
- [Hardware Dependencies, e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino]

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ameer-alwadiya/Autonomous-Obstacle-Avoidance.git
   cd Autonomous-Obstacle-Avoidance
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Create a virtual environment and install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the System:**

   Follow the configuration instructions in `config/README.md` to set up your system.

### Usage

To run the obstacle avoidance system, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Ensure that all hardware components are connected and properly configured before running the system.
