## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ameer-alwadiya/Autonomous-Obstacle-Avoidance.git
   cd Autonomous-Obstacle-Avoidance
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Create a virtual environment and install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the System:**

   Follow the configuration instructions in `config/README.md` to set up your system.

### Usage

To run the obstacle avoidance system, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Ensure that all hardware components are connected and properly configured before running the system.
